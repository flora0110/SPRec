This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation and reproduction for the paper titled "SPRec: Leveraging Self-Play to Debias Preference Alignment for Large Language Model-based Recommendations" 

## Installation

1. Clone this git repository and change directory to this repository:

2. A new [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html) is suggested. 

    ```bash
    conda create --name SPRec python=3.10 -y
    ```

3. Activate the newly created environment.

    ```bash
    conda activate SPRec
    ```

4. Install the required modules from pip.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


## Quick Start

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, we have uploaded the minimal sample dataset **Goodreads** in `./data/Goodreads` and `./eval/Goodreads` for reproduction purposes. Additionally, the datasets used in our experiments—**MovieLens**, **CDs and Vinyl**, and **Steam**—will be uploaded to [ link coming soon ] later. If you wish to use a different dataset, please ensure that it is processed into a similar format.

Besides, to ensure that SPRec does not encounter more training data during multiple iterations compared to other baseline methods, it is recommended to sample the training dataset beforehand to limit its size. The sample dataset we provide has already been sampled and contains 5,000 entries. You can further sample it according to your requirements to control the total amount of data SPRec is exposed to during training.


### How to Train Using SPRec Framework

1. **SFT Training**:  
   Before using the SPRec training framework, you need to run SFT to fine-tune your base model for alignment with the recommendation task. Use the following command to perform SFT training:  
   ```bash
   bash ./shell/SFT.sh 0 1 2 3 # Specify your GPUs, e.g., 0 1 2 3
2. **SPRec Training**:    
    After completing SFT training, use the following command to perform SPRec training:
    ```bash
    bash ./shell/SPRec.sh 0 1 2 3 5 # Specify your GPUs, e.g., 0 1 2 3, and the number of iterations, e.g., 5
Once the above commands are executed, the evaluation results for top-1 and top-5 recommendations will be saved as eval_top1.json and eval_top5.json in the corresponding model directory.
